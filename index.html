        <p>We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. What? We're not at all alike! I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Well, that's certainly good to know. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Travel time to the nearest starbase? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Sorry, Data. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement.</p>
